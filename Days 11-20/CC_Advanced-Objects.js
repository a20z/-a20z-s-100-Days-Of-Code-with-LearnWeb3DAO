/*
The this keyword

A function's this keyword behaves a litel differently in JavaScript compared to 
other languages.
In most cases the value of this is determined by how a functio is callled (runtime binding).
It cant be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function
is called.

this does not work woith arrow functions becuase arrow functions inherently bind
an already defined this value to the function iteself that is NOT callin gobject.

  that a funky string is printed to the console! This is known as a side-effect of type-coercion. 
  No need to worry about what this means for now, but itâ€™s important to understand that you can

// Exercise 4 - Getters

/*  Getters are medthods that get and return the internal properties of an object

Notable advantages of using getter methods:

# getters can preform an action on the data when getrting a property
# getters can return different values using conditionals
# in a getter we can access the properties of the calling using this
# the functionality of code becomes easier for developers to understand+

/* Review

# the obkect that a method belongs o is called the calling object
# the this keyword refers to the calling object and can be used to access properties of the calling object
# methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object
# the value of this depends on where the this is being accesseed from 
# we cannot use arrorw functions as methods if we want to access other internal propertis
# javascript objects do not jave built-in priivacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify
  other developoers aboout the code
# the usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for 
  that property to be disrectly changed
# setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways pf accessing and assigning properties
# factory functions allow us to create object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and
  another is destructured asasignment
