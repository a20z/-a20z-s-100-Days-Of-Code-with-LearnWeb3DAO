/*
The this keyword

A function's this keyword behaves a litel differently in JavaScript compared to 
other languages.
In most cases the value of this is determined by how a functio is callled (runtime binding).
It cant be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function
is called.

// Exercise 2 - Arrow functions and this 

/*
this does not work woith arrow functions becuase arrow functions inherently bind
an already defined this value to the function iteself that is NOT callin gobject.

  that a funky string is printed to the console! This is known as a side-effect of type-coercion. 
  No need to worry about what this means for now, but itâ€™s important to understand that you can 
  cause unwanted side-effects when mutating objects and their properties.
