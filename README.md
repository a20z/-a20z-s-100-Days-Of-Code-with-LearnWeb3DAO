Hello there!

Thiis is me going through the 100 days of code challenge. 

General plan:

Finish Codecademy's JavaScript Course
Alchemy's JavaScript Course
Alchemy's Solidity BootCamp
Alchemy's Blockchain development course
32-hour Solidity course
Crypto Zombies

I think my eventual goal is to get an on-chain game, or some sort of dapp running

I will post all the code I write into this repositoty. 

2023 is gonna be code-intensive!!
