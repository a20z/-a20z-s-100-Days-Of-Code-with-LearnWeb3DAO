// Alchemy Array Reduce

/*
The reduce() method executes a user-supplied "reducer" callback function on each element of thje array,
in order, passing the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of 
running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value

The first time that the callebakc is run, there is no "return value of the previous calculation". 
If supplied, an initial value may br used in its place. Otherwise the array element at index 0 is
used as the initial valu and iteration starts from the next element (index 1 instead of 0)

WHEN SHOULD YOU USE REDUCE? 

Use the reduce method when you haqve an array of elements you'd like to combine into a 
single value or object
